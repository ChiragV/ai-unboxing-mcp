## Course Description

MCP, the Model Context Protocol, enables you to connect pretty much anything to AI. In this livestream series-turned-course, LinkedIn Principal Instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen unboxes MCP. Youâ€™ll learn what MCP is and why it matters. Then get hands on and learn how to build MCP servers from scratch, use cutting edge features like elicitation and sampling, manage security and authorization, and deploy remote MCP servers for easier access and use.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This course originated as a livestream on LinkedIn, so the exercise files are organized in folders by the day of the event. Each folder contains one or more MCP server projects. Each sub-project has a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to use it. Some folders contain completed MCP servers, others contain challenges, half-completed projects, or other materials.

For reference:

- `day-02/` = Chapter 2
- `day-03/` = Chapter 3
- `day-05/` = Chapter 5

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot
    - Claude Desktop (optional)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
3. Follow the instructions in the course and in the respective `README.md` files for each project.
