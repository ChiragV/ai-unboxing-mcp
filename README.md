## Course Description

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This course originated as a livestream on LinkedIn, so the exercise files are organized in folders by the day of the event. Each folder contains one or more MCP server projects. Each sub-project has a `README.md` file with detailed instructions on how to use it. Some folders contain completed MCP servers, others contain challenges, half-completed projects, or other materials.

For reference:

- `day-02` = Chapter 2
- `day-03` = Chapter 3
- `day-05` = Chapter 5

## Installing
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot
    - Claude Desktop (optional)
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.
